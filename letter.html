hello, merry xmas
i made this little thing as a way to greet you with warm words despite the 
night being cold. i hope you're doing well, it's been awhile since we last 
had a conversation together, we've grown quite distant towards one another.
but, that's just how it is LOL. i have to admit that i've thought of you for at least
twice or thrice, thinking about your well-being. 
i love writing letters, im not sure if i've brought that up to you but if i haven't then 
here u go. letters are just really amazing, i'm writing all these words down based on how i'm feeling
right now, hoping you could possibly feel the warmth i have in me. 
i wish for us to meet soon so i can at least open up to you about my very own reasons on why i decided to 
leave you hanging. this is just a sweet christmas note w/o bringing up what's considered to be negative.
hope this letter finds you well, possibly making you smile at least a little.
may everything you carry become beautiful, i hope this upcoming year treats you gently.
greeting you with love, peace, and happiness.

sincerely,
zeeve
